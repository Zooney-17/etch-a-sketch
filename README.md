# etch-a-sketch

Here is my submission for the etch-a-sketch project from The Odin Project.

This project makes use of all previous lessons up until this point in the curricuculm with an emphasis on DOM manipulation and events.

The initial steps of the project were pretty straightforward until the final step which was to scale the grid size according to the user's input. Most of my research led me to code that utilized CSS Grid as a solution but I was determined to complete the project using the lessons learned in TOP thus far. It wasn't until I came across the solution implemented in https://github.com/robertsGeorge/Etch-A-Sketch that I was able to complete the assignment within my set parameters.

The end result is pretty barebones but maybe keeping it that way for a while will help other Odinites who are stuck with the same issue.
